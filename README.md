Code built in R studio to analyse data from MEA platform Acea xCELLigence. Analsyses data such as beat rate, beat amplitude, etc. Calculates group means, standard error (also standard deviation). Creates grouped bar charts over time with error bars using ggplot2 and bbplot. 

Ensure data is in same format as the test data set. Must be in csv format and column names must be the same. Can be changed later in the graph to match actual measurements.
